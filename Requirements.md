 "High" and "Low" level requirements.
 -ðŸ”€First, the distinction, if examined literally, doesn't seem to make sense. A user has certain problems she wants solved; requirements state the least stringent conditions 
 that must hold to know that you've solved them.
 
 -ðŸ”€I don't consider problems as being either high level or low level, so why would there be "requirements levels"? Imagine saying to a user, "Oh, that's just a low level problem,
 so let's not worry about it now. I'm just documenting high level requirements."
 
 -ðŸ”€Second, I believe the valid distinction is between requirements specifications and design specifications. If you specify user goals and constraints on those goals, you stay at a
 "high level", and you are documenting requirements.
 
 -ðŸ”€If you specify how the user will interact with the product in order to satisfy those goals and constraints, however, you are certainly getting into low-level details. But then 
 you are specifying design, not requirements.
 
 -ðŸ”€Third, both high and low level specifications are important. Denying that low-level specifications are requirements by no means diminishes their importance. It just helps to 
 understand when you're doing requirements and when you're doing design.
